Rotate Painter - Spin To Draw

Rotate Painter is the only iOS app that combines drawing and juggling in one exciting package. It uses your deviceâ€™s gyroscope to draw pictures while you spin it. 

You can have gotten interesting results by spinning my iPhone in an office chair, or tossing it (gently!) into the air with a spin. Pick from a library of twelve handcrafted color schemes. Combine them to create something new!
